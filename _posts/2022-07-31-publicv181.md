### Features added:

Tweaks:
- Added a toggle to show/hide the leaderboard and name tags with multiplayer, by doing so you can play hide'n'seek in Jump King! (thanks Volcanic and DolpIn_62!)
- `GhostPlayer`s will now show with a opacity and a colored name tag instead of a colored king with a default name tag.
- Players will now be hidden behind hidden walls and foreground just like the main player.
- Added menu for JumpPercentage that allows the player to switch from Percentage to in-game frames. (thanks Brunov!)
- Added toggle to enable XY Coordinates in non-custom maps (thanks Brunov!)

Fixes:
- Fixed lag related to `GhostPlayer`s, increased number of packets per second to assure a more fluid gameplay in multiplayer.
- Fixed an issue with TeleportLink being broken on certain double teleport occasions (thanks Bruno!)
- Fixed an issue causing Proton to crash when opening a non-custom map. (thanks kkaero!)
